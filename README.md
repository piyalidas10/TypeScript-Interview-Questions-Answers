| 1   |  Does Typescript run in the browser ? <br><br> TypeScript cannot be run or understood in any browser. So, TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript (which browsers can understand) using TSC(TypeScript) compiler. To install TSC compoiler, we have to install Node.js as we need NPM.
| 2   |  What is TypeScript? <br><br> TypeScript is a statically typed language and a superset of JavaScript that builds on top of JavaScript’s existing syntax and functionality. This means that you can use JavaScript in your TypeScript code, but you can't use TypeScript in your JavaScript code as code written in TypeScript uses features and syntax not present in JavaScript. TypeScript must be compiled (transpiled is another term as it isn’t converting to a low-level language) to JavaScript to run in web browsers and in environments like Node.js. The file extension for TypeScript is .ts. 
| 3   |  Undefined vs Null ? <br><br> Undefined means the variable is written there but there is no existence of it in the memory. Undefined is a data type. `let a: number; console.log(a); console.log(typeof a);` <br> Null is a value whose type is Object. `let a = null; console.log(a); console.log(typeof a);` 
| 4   |  What is template literals or Template strings? <br><br> Template literals, also known as template strings, are a feature in JavaScript that allow for easier string interpolation and multi-line strings. They are denoted by backticks instead of single or double quotes. <br/><br/> 1) Display variable value without using concatenation `let a = 90; let str = 'value of a is ${a}'; console.log(str);` <br/> 2) The way you write string inside, it will appear as it is. `let str = 'one          two         three'; console.log(str);`
| 5   |  What is a type alias in TypeScript? <br><br> Type aliases in TypeScript allow you to create custom names for complex types, making your code more readable and maintainable. They are particularly useful when dealing with complex data structures, union types, and other scenarios where you want to give a clear name to a specific type. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-typescript-type-aliases-work/
| 6   |  What is an union type in TypeScript? <br><br> A union type describes a value that can be one of several types. We use the vertical bar ( | ) to separate each type, so number | string | boolean is the type of a value that can be a number , a string , or a boolean . `type pincode = number | string; function printStatusCode(code: string | number) {};`
| 7   |  What is never type TypeScript? <br><br> never type represents the type of values that never occur. <strong>Never</strong> means This function will not complete till the last line and before the finish it breaks so it will never return a value. Here you may have a question that when the function is not returning anything, then why don't we use Void as a return type? Well, because there is a difference. <strong>Generally a function not returning anything can be defined as void, but still returns undefined. But if you have never data type, it will give a compile time error. </strong> let see the code `let x: void = undefined; let y: never = undefined;` you will get error on never type "Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'never'." <br/> https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#:~:text=The%20never%20type%20represents%20the,that%20can%20never%20be%20true.
